        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <P>After 17 years working in IT, i've decided to change things in my life. Wanted to create something by
            myself without any other direction than the one i choose. So i've quit my IT specialist job to start somethinge else.
            I successfully gone through exams and validate diplomas as life and business coach. That allows me to 
            create my own training process, named Metaphore. With it, i trained lot of people about softskills, professionnal life but,
            as i love to create (i'm creating stories, bordgames), i continued to do it. Following, i've launch Wivzem, a marketplace
            design for handcrafters, allowing them to sell objects, exchange in a communuty and learn new things. But to manage everthing 
            from A to Z on this new plateform, i had to complete my cursus with a training as Web dev.
        </P>
